#Use the mloa_2001 data set (if you don’t have it, download the .rda file from the resources tab on the website). Remeber to remove the NAs (-99 and -999) and to create a datetime column (we did this in class).

#Then, write a function called plot_temp that returns a graph of the temp_C_2m for a single month. The x-axis of the graph should be pulled from a datetime column (so if your data set does not already have a datetime column, you’ll need to create one!)



mloa_2001$datetime<- ymd_hm(mloa_2001$datetime)
mloa2 <- mloa_2001 %>% 
  filter(rel_humid != -99, rel_humid != -999) %>% 
  filter(temp_C_2m!= -99, temp_C_2m != -999) %>% 
  filter(windSpeed_m_s!= -99, windSpeed_m_s != -999)

plot_temp <- function(singlemonth, dat = mloa2){
  df <- filter(dat, month == singlemonth)
  plot <- df %>% 
    ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x=datetime, y = temp_C_2m)) + theme_classic()
  return(plot)
}

# test the function for April (month 4)

plot_temp(4)
 # it works!
